# Timebox your shit and get it done

I always find time-boxing daily todos a helpful constraint towards getting shit done.

So I made this simple app for creating and managing timers for daily todos.  You can save your timers, name them, and jot down notes and reminders for each timer you create.

Built for desktop.  Install on your Desktop as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your desktop (see below).

Save your timers and progress and return to them any time you want.

All timer data - including names and notes - is stored
<em>locally</em> (and <em>only</em> locally) in your browser.
