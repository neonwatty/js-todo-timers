# My timers

I always find time-boxing daily tasks a helpful constraint towards getting shit done.

So I made this free web app for creating and managing timers to organize daily tasks.  Built for mobile and desktop.

[Click here to use the app right now in your browser](https://neonwatty.github.io/my_timers/).

Save your timers and progress and return to them any time you want.

All timer data - including names and notes - are stored
<em>locally</em> in your browser.
